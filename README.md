[comment]: <> (## DataSets)

### DataSets

* MNIST


### Executing program

* These mlx files must be opened in an instance of Matlab
* MLX is the matlab live script format allowing for code to be readable next to generated confusion maps
```

```

## Help

These scripts were created in MATLAB R2022b, if you run into any errors, check your MATLAB version.
